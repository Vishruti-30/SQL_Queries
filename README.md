## 🔍 Key Analytical Queries

Here are the included analytical SQL queries:

1. **View all orders** with customer and product details  
2. **Total sales by region**  
3. **Top 3 customers** by total spend  
4. **Order count per customer**  
5. **Total units sold per product**  
6. **Customers with multiple product types ordered**  
7. **Average order value per customer**  
8. **Most recent order per customer**  
9. **Monthly sales trend**
